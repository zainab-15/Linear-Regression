# Linear-Regression

## Linear Regression 

This project demonstrates how the Gradient Descent Algorithm can be used to solve a Linear Regression problem, as opposed to utilizing libraries like Scikit-Learn. It provides an educational insight into the underlying mechanics of linear regression by implementing it from the ground up.

## Project Overview

Linear Regression is a fundamental algorithm in machine learning used for predicting a continuous dependent variable based on one or more independent variables. This project focuses on:
	•	Implementing Linear Regression using the Gradient Descent optimization algorithm.
	•	Understanding the step-by-step process of minimizing the cost function.
	•	Comparing the custom implementation with standard library approaches.

## Repository Structure

The repository contains the following key files:
	•	Linear-Regression.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook detailing the implementation of Linear Regression using Gradient Descent, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
	•	README.md: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the project.

## Technologies Used
	•	Programming Language: Python ￼
	•	Libraries:
	•	NumPy
	•	Matplotlib
	•	Jupyter Notebook

## Getting Started
	1.	Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/zainab-15/Linear-Regression.git
    cd Linear-Regression


	2.	Install the required libraries:
     Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the necessary libraries:

    pip install numpy matplotlib


	3.	Run the Jupyter Notebook:

    jupyter notebook Linear-Regression.ipynb

This will open the notebook in your default web browser, allowing you to interact with the code and visualize the results.

## Results

The notebook provides visualizations to illustrate:
	•	The convergence of the cost function over iterations.
	•	The fitted regression line over the data points.

These visual aids help in understanding how the Gradient Descent algorithm optimizes the model parameters.
